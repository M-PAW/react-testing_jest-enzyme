# Test Driven Development
    - Before writing your code, it's a good idea to write your tests,
      all of which will initial fail until the code is completed.
      
      There are a few reasons for this:
      1. Your code won't need to be refactored later to allow for test coverage
      2. You code quality will be higher and less likely to have bugs
      3. Better organized code
      4. More testable / better coverage
